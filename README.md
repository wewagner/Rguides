Welcome to the Self-Study Guide for a soft introduction to coding in R and R Studio!

Specifically written for UCSD students, this guide walks you through the basics of working in R and R Studio, from complete novice to making customized plots in ggplot2. 
It covers the basics of R language, common operators and procedures, to more advanced data manipulation and visualization.

Of course, these guides can only be the beginning - and there is much more to learn. But after completing these straight forward tutorials, 
you should be able to understand suggestions to common data problems you find in forums, YouTube, or through AI tools.
